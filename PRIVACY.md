# Privacy Policy for HonZuki

**Last Updated: December 21, 2025**

## The Simple Version

**I collect NOTHING. Your data never leaves your device.**

- ✅ All your books, reading progress, and settings are stored **locally on your device only**
- ✅ No accounts, no login, no servers, no cloud storage
- ✅ I have **zero access** to your data
- ✅ Your reading habits are completely private

That's it. That's the whole story for the current version.

## What You Should Know

### 1. Your Data Stays Local
Everything you add (books, progress, notes, settings) is stored in your browser's **localStorage**. I literally cannot see it.

### 2. Camera Permission (If You Use Barcode Scanner)
- **Only used** when you tap the "Scan Barcode" button
- **Purpose**: Read ISBN barcodes from physical books
- **No images saved** - just extracts the ISBN number
- **Completely optional** - you can use the app without this

### 3. Book Lookups (When You Search ISBN/Titles)
When you look up a book by ISBN or title, that request goes to:
- **Google Books API** - to fetch book info (title, author, cover)
- **Open Library** - as a backup source
- **Goodreads** - for series information

**What's sent**: Only the ISBN/title you're searching for. NO personal info, NO library data.

**Why this matters**: Google/these services may log your IP address like any website visit.

### 4. Future Plans (Not Active Yet)
In a future update, I plan to add optional cloud accounts, sync via Firebase, and public sharing. When that happens, I'll update this policy.

- Use at your own risk
